      <description>Running a hobby server at home can be a great way to learn something new. Hobby Linux servers have been a passion of mine for their simplicity and cost. They can be a quick way to kick the tires on an interesting CRM, ticket system, media server, etc. One of my favorite sites for this is TurnKey Linux. While testing on a local hobby server may work just fine for most situations, there may be an instance where you want to have a public or remote access to your server.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around with my new Creality CR-6 SE 3D printer recently. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic printer if you can overlook it&amp;rsquo;s newness flaws. 3D prints are typically created with a CAD application and saved to a .stl file. The .stl file then needs to be converted to gcode or &amp;ldquo;sliced&amp;rdquo; using a slicer application. Cura by Ultimaker is good slicer, but it does not currently have a printer profile for the Creality CR-6 SE 3D printer.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun little project that lets you check offline if your password has been pwned. Download the SHA-1 password database here and name it pwned-passwords-sha1-ordered-by-count-v6.txt. Then copy the following text into a BeenPwned.sh file in the same directory as the password hash that was downloaded. When run it will prompt for &amp;ldquo;Password to search:&amp;rdquo;. Type in a password and press enter. The script will hash the password you typed and check the hash agains the database.</description>
